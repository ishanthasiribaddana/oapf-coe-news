Centre of Excellence: Shaping the Future of Learning at Ananda College
By the COE Lead Consultants Committee
 December 2025
A New Chapter Begins
On a warm Sunday afternoon, 14 December 2025, a distinguished group of academics, professionals, and visionaries gathered at the Colombo Club, Taj Samudra Hotel. Their shared purpose was clear: to shape the next phase of the Centre of Excellence (COE) at Ananda College—an initiative that aims to redefine how young Anandians learn, think, and contribute to the nation.
What emerged from this meeting was not merely a set of operational decisions, but a bold educational philosophy—one rooted in real-world relevance, innovation, values, and human development.
From Curriculum to Creation
One of the most significant outcomes of the meeting was a unanimous decision to move away from the traditional notion of a “curriculum.” Instead, the COE will operate on a Project-Based Framework.
This shift reflects a deeper belief: that the future belongs to learners who can solve problems, work with ambiguity, collaborate across disciplines, and transform ideas into impact. Every COE centre will therefore be anchored in hands-on projects, experiential learning, and applied outcomes—bridging theory with practice in meaningful ways.
Strengthening the Foundation: Governance and Operations
To support this ambitious vision, the Steering Committee approved the recruitment of a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to lead day-to-day operations and strategic execution. Alongside this, the need for structured governance, standard operating procedures, and transparent reporting mechanisms was acknowledged.
A dedicated governance session will follow, ensuring that the COE is not only visionary in spirit but also robust, accountable, and sustainable in practice.
Digital Enablement for Modern Learning
Recognizing the importance of digital platforms in contemporary education, the committee confirmed that a Learning Management System (LMS) will be made available free of charge to the COE. Hosted on a dedicated server, this platform will support blended learning, documentation, collaboration, and assessment.
In parallel, the use of Google Classroom is being explored to complement COE activities, ensuring accessibility and scalability from the outset.
The Eight Flagship Proposals: Pillars of the COE Vision
At the heart of the COE are eight flagship centres and initiatives, each addressing a critical dimension of future-ready education.
1. Artificial Intelligence Innovation Centre
Designed for high-potential post-O/L students, this centre focuses on AI, machine learning, and data-driven problem solving. Beyond technical competence, it emphasizes ethical AI, responsibility, and innovation aligned with societal needs.
2. Entrepreneurship & Innovation Centre
This centre blends STEAM education with entrepreneurship, guiding students from idea generation to prototyping and venture thinking. Grounded in values and sustainability, it nurtures creators who are not only commercially aware but also socially conscious.
3. Fine Arts & Digital Arts Centre
Where tradition meets technology, this centre integrates classical fine arts with modern digital expression. Students develop portfolios, participate in exhibitions, and gain exposure to creative industries—locally and globally.
4. Applied Science & Research Centre
A hub for scientific curiosity, this centre supports research-based learning, Olympiad preparation, and applied experimentation. Students are encouraged to ask questions, test hypotheses, and contribute to knowledge creation.
5. Mathematics Excellence Centre
Focused on advanced mathematical thinking, this centre prepares students for national and international mathematics competitions while strengthening logical reasoning, analytical depth, and problem-solving skills.
6. Media Centre of Excellence
Responding to the evolving media landscape, this centre equips students with skills in radio, television, digital, and convergent media. Emphasis is placed on content creation, production workflows, and entrepreneurial media initiatives.

7. Good Ambassadors Auditorium
More than an auditorium, this is the moral and emotional heart of the COE. Through storytelling, reflection, dialogue, and role models, students develop character, empathy, resilience, and leadership. Success here is measured not only by achievement, but by Gross Individual Happiness (GIH).
8. STEAM Applied Technology Projects
Hands-on technology projects—including microcontroller-based water meters and weather monitoring systems—allow students to move from design to prototype to real-world application. These initiatives foster systems thinking, sustainability awareness, and product development skills.
Looking Ahead
With a target launch date of 15 May 2025, preparatory academic activities will begin immediately where possible. Upcoming phases will focus on finalizing governance frameworks, budgets, staffing structures, and partnerships—ensuring the COE opens not just on time, but with purpose and excellence.
A Collective Vision
The Centre of Excellence at Ananda College represents a decisive shift—from education as information delivery to education as transformation. It seeks to develop students who are intellectually capable, emotionally grounded, ethically strong, and globally relevant.
As this journey unfolds, the continued engagement of members, alumni, educators, and partners will remain essential. Together, we are not merely building centres—we are shaping the future of learning, leadership, and nation-building.
